## Congratulation!! You now have a full command-line bash shell based on Kali Linx, or whatever other Linux distribution you installed.

# How to Use The Bash Shell
To open the Linux environment you installed, just open the Start menu and search for whatever distribution you installed.<br/> 
For example, if you installed Ubuntu, launch the Ubuntu shortcut.<br/>

You can pin this application shortcut to your Start menu, taskbar, or desktop for easier access.<br/>

### The first time you launch the Linux environment, you’re be prompted to enter a UNIX username and password. These don’t have to match your Windows username and password, but will be used within the Linux environment.<br/>
For example, if you enter “stephan” and “toor” as your credentials, your username in the Linux environment will be “stephan” and the password you use inside the Linux environment will be “toor”—no matter what your Windows username and password are.
