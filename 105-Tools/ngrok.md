### What is ngrok?
ngrok is a reverse proxy that creates a secure tunnel from a public endpoint to a locally running web service. ngrok captures and analyzes all traffic over the tunnel for later inspection and replay.

### What can I do with ngrok?
* Expose any http service behind a NAT or firewall to the internet on a subdomain of ngrok.com
* Expose any tcp service behind a NAT or firewall to the internet on a random port of ngrok.com
* Inspect all http requests/responses that are transmitted over the tunnel
* Replay any request that was transmitted over the tunnel

## What is ngrok useful for?
* Temporarily sharing a website that is only running on your development machine
* Demoing an app at a hackathon without deploying
* Developing any services which consume webhooks (HTTP callbacks) by allowing you to replay those requests
* Debugging and understanding any web service by inspecting the HTTP traffic
* Running networked services on machines that are firewalled off from the internet
