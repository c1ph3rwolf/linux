Metasploit Developer Documentation

*(last updated December 1, 2014)

Metasploit is actively supported by a community of hundreds of contributors and thousands of users world-wide. As a result, the accompanying documentation moves quite quickly.

The best source of documentation on Metasploit development is https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki. There are many treasures there, such as:

   Evading Antivirus
   How Payloads Work                         https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/How-payloads-work
   How to use Datastore Options
   How to write browser exploits with BES
   How to write a bruteforcer

...and many, many more.
